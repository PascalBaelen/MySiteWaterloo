<h2>Working at NSSO</h2>

<p>Glad you made it here as well ! Well, you should be on my more "serious" page now ... no more Napoleon here ...</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working at the NSSO, National Social Security Office, at the Midi Station (for 2 years now) ...</p>

<p>Been around, before I worked for the OSSO, Oversees Social Security Office, there I worked for almost 20 years...</p>

<p>And in 2014, I also made a jump to DIBISS... this was the Office for "Local Cases in the Social Security" ...</p>

<p>Ah, and below, a picture of me, I sometimes change my looks; beard, moustache, sideburns ... </p>

<p>So next time you see me, I might look completely differently !</p>

<p>The only constant element in all my pictures are cats ... unless I'm on horseback charging the Britisch !</p>

<p>But seriously, I'm very interested in learning Java, and being a full stack Java developer. Coding is fun !</p><br>

<p><em>Hope seeing you all soon in class !</em></p><br>

<p>ps : did I mention I have a picture of my cats on my desktop ? <strong>"Hard to believe"</strong> I hear you think...</p><br>
