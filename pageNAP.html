<h2>Napoleonic Warfare reenactors</h2>

<p>Glad you made it ! Well, I'm not insane, I just like the Napoleonic period and have done some reenactment in the past !</p>

<p>I also like to collect stuff from this period, documents, battlefield relics, engravings, sabres, old books (memoires f.i. Les mémoires du général Marbot), old pocket watches etc ...</p>

<p>And of course, it's a good thing living only 35 km away from Waterloo ...</p>

<p>I must admit however, that sometimes, and for a brief moment, I may lose myself back to the past, seeing everybody around me, living and dressed like 200 years ago ...</p>

<p>I could go on for centuries about this topic, but this humble site is just to wet your appetites...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my friends and family know me as <em>"Le soldat de Waterloo, Jean-Baptiste Baelen"</em>, in honor of my ancestor, born in 1797, died in 1815 at Mont-Saint-Jean (Waterloo)</p><br>
